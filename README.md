# Cryptographic-Solutions-for-Supply-Chain-Security
The project presents a comprehensive cryptographic framework to secure supply chain operations and combat issues like counterfeiting and unauthorized tampering. It leverages public key cryptography using the RSA algorithm to enable secure digital signatures and ensure the authenticity of transactions. Additionally, hash functions are applied to maintain data integrity by verifying that transaction data remains untampered throughout the process. By integrating these cryptographic techniques with blockchain technology, IoT, RFID, and machine learning, the proposed solution creates a transparent and traceable system that effectively validates and records supply chain transactions. Overall, the results demonstrate that these methods can successfully detect fraudulent activities and secure supply chain data, thereby enhancing trust and reliability.
